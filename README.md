This repo explains why we need MLOps.

##### Current Scenario mostly

Currently we don’t have much people skilled in MLOps and companies are either upskilling DevOps Engineers to do system engineer tasks like write python classes and create modules and completing machine learning operations or vice versa like system engineers are upskilled to do operations tasks and completing machine learning operations.

It is because many companies like start-ups, they don’t get funds and they are not able to create separate MLOps team.

Only if we show business value to the clients, then we can get funds, we can use cloud service, we can create separate team for MLOps and all...

Few companies have separate Data Engineering, Data Science, ML Ops Team (People are in learning stage) since they have showed business value and clients trusted and spending for it.

##### Future

In Future, ML Engineers are expected to do both ML Dev + ML Ops.

If we work for service based companies, clients use either gcp or azure or aws and we can easily do MLOps.

If we work for start-ups and does not have too much funds, we will doing everything locally using like MLflow for experiments tracking and model registry, docker for containers, Kubernetes clusters for maintaining containers, Jenkins, GitHub actions for CI/CD and automated testing...

We also expect to be as a solution architect like what would be the components involved, what tech stack to be used for particular use-case, what would be the architectural decision, security related tasks, we should be knowing end to end like what is the use-case and what is the end product, based on that we would solution it.

Only if we show business value or at least one MVP ready for business users to see, show then what is ROI, then only we will get funds.

##### Introducing MLOps

Now-a-days, many companies are only doing POC’s and not able to scale up their model to production ready, which means eventually the model dies in few years, that’s why there is a need for MLOps to make it to production ready. 

But MLOps is not only deploying the model, its end-to-end starts from data ingestion till the model serving, even after to monitor it.

##### Organizations are looking to scale DATA, ANALYTICS AND AI to keep pace with new demands.

##### Rapid Speed of Digital Transformation

Data, Analytics and AI form the backbone for digital transformation.

Expectations from data programs is ever increasing.

The need for smart, automated data analytics has intensified.

##### Accelerated movement to cloud

Cloud is becoming the standard solution for D&A applications.

Ever increasing tools ion Cloud and D&A space.

##### Data driven reinvention

Data is treated as a critical enterprise asset.

Organization yet figure out how to harness the vast sea of data effectively.

##### Systems using continuous Intelligence

Using real-time context data to improve decisions.

Systems and applications require rapid changes.

Only through increased automation via AI and ML will this diverse and dynamic data be manageable economically.

##### Increased cost of non-compliance

Enhanced analytics and reporting.

Compliance to external regulations.

Data Security and privacy needs.

##### A Full-Blown Operationalization Requires Integration of Three Essential Capabilities.

##### 1 - Data Operations (DataOps)

Data Operations delivers the capabilities to industrialize the data supply chain for AI/ML. It provides capabilities to discover, acquire, curate and provision data for downstream usage.

##### 2 - Data Science

Data Science delivers the capabilities to accelerate and industrialize the application of ML techniques by data scientists and data analysts. It has key capabilities for data exploration as well as for iterative building, testing, tuning and evaluation of ML models for deployment.

##### 3 - ML Operations

ML Operations delivers the capabilities to productionize ML powered applications such that they can be packaged, deployed, monitored and calibrated for enterprise usage @scale.

But now all three combines called as MLOps.
