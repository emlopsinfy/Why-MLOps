This repo explains why we need MLOps.

##### Current Scenario mostly

Currently we don’t have much people skilled in MLOps and companies are either upskilling DevOps Engineers to do system engineer tasks like write python classes and create modules and completing machine learning operations or vice versa like system engineers are upskilled to do operations tasks and completing machine learning operations.

It is because many companies like start-ups, they don’t get funds and they are not able to create separate MLOps team.

Only if we show business value to the clients, then we can get funds, we can use cloud tech, we can create separate team for MLOps and all...

Few companies have separate Data Engineering, Data Science, ML Ops Team - People are in learning stage since they have showed business value and clients trusted and spending for it.

##### Future

In Future, ML Engineers are expected to do both ML Dev + ML Ops.

If we work for service based companies, clients use either gcp or azure or aws and we can easily do MLOps.

If we work for start-ups and does not have too much funds, we will doing everything locally using like MLflow for experiments tracking and model registry, docker for containers, Kubernetes clusters for maintaining containers, Jenkins, GitHub actions for CI/CD and automated testing...

We also expect to be as a solution architect like what would be the components involved, what tech stack to be used for particular use-case, what would be the architectural decision, security related tasks, we should be knowing end to end like what is the use-case and what is the end product, based on that we would solution it.

Till we show business value or at least one MVP ready for business users to see, show then what is ROI, then only we will get funds.







Airflow for scheduling the pipeline.

Azure - Data Engineering Synopsis

It is Azure analytics platform, we can do from data engineering, data cleaning, modelling, also integrate with  Power BI. It is an end to end analytics platform.
